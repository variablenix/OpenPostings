## Save behavior

When you click `Save Sync Settings`:

- Auto-sync timing settings are saved locally in app state.
- Queue concurrency is persisted to backend settings endpoint.
- UI confirms the saved mode and restart requirement for runtime concurrency updates.

## Recommended settings profile

- Start at `3600` seconds interval.
- Keep queue concurrency at `1-3` unless your network and ATS targets are stable.
- Block repeat-noise companies to reduce daily review load.
