## Postings workflow

On the `Postings` page, each card opens the original job URL and includes an action menu (`...`) with three core actions:

- `Save To Applications`
- `Ignore Job Posting`
- `Block Company`

## Save To Applications

Use `Save To Applications` when you have applied (or want to track that posting).

What happens:

- The posting is added to your Applications list.
- The posting is removed from the Postings list in the current view.
- It is labeled with an attribution string in Applications.

## Ignore Job Posting

Use `Ignore Job Posting` to hide a single posting without blocking the entire company.

What happens:

- The posting is marked as ignored in backend state.
- It is removed from the visible Postings list.
- Other postings from the same company can still appear.

## Block Company

Use `Block Company` to suppress all postings from that company.

What happens:

- The company is added to blocked companies.
- Its postings are hidden from Postings.
- It is excluded from future sync collection.
- You can unblock it in `Settings > Sync Settings`.

## Manage tracked applications

Go to the `Applications` page to review and update statuses.

Available status values:

- `applied`
- `interview scheduled`
- `awaiting response`
- `offer received`
- `withdrawn`
- `denied`

You can also delete an entry from Applications.

## Best-practice flow

1. Sync postings.
2. Filter and review.
3. Save or ignore each posting.
4. Block repeated low-value companies.
5. Update application statuses as your pipeline changes.
