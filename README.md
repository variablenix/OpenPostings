## Android Install from Google PlayStore (Easiest Setup)
If you are interested in being a beta tester follow the Google Form here:

- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jatonjustice.openpostings&hl=en_US

## Android Phone/Device DIRECT Install
You can download the latest app from the github releases page and run it.

- https://github.com/Masterjx9/OpenPostings/releases/download/v2.0.1/app-release.apk

## Windows Installer Setup (Windows 10/11) (Easiest Setup But Still WIP and may have some bugs)
Download the latest installer from the github releases page and run it. It will guide you through installation and setup.
- https://github.com/Masterjx9/OpenPostings/releases/download/v2.0.1/openpostings-2.0.1-x64.msi

Choose the setup type during install:
- `Typical`: Installs the standard OpenPostings app setup (Includes the backend service worker, recommended for most users).
- `Complete`: Installs all available OpenPostings features. (Includes the backend service worker and MCP apply agent server, which may not be needed for all users).
- `Custom`: Lets you choose exactly which features to install (for example, whether to include the backend service worker and MCP apply agent server).
<img src="README-Images/windows_setup_type.png" alt="windows install setup types" width="70%" />

Once the installation is complete, you can launch OpenPostings from the start menu.

## MacOS Direct Install (There will never be a playstore version as Apple's Garden wall requires 100 soul bucks every year just for a free app, this its outside of scope of an opensource application)
You can download the lastest app from the github releases page and run it.

- https://github.com/Masterjx9/OpenPostings/releases/download/v2.0.1/openpostings-2.0.1-universal.dmg

## Source Installation Setup (Best Stability & Compatibility)

### Requirements

- Node.js 18+ and npm
  - https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
- For Windows target: React Native Windows prerequisites
  - https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/
- For Android target: Android Studio/emulator or device
  - https://developer.android.com/studio

### Installation

```powershell
cd OpenPostings
npm install
```

### Quick Start (Web)

Terminal 1:

```powershell
cd OpenPostings
npm run server
```

Terminal 2:

```powershell
cd OpenPostings
npm run web
```

Access the Web UI
- `http://localhost:8081`

Default API base URL behavior:
- Web/Windows: `http://localhost:8787`
- Android (on-device backend): `http://127.0.0.1:8787`

### You can run this Windows or Android as well!

```powershell
npm run windows (For windows)
npm run android (For Android)
```

## Docker (Self-Hosted / Reverse Proxy)

Run OpenPostings on a server or homelab using Docker. The setup splits into
two containers — one for the Expo web frontend and one for the Express API —
both using the same image.

> **Note:** The API URL is baked into the Expo bundle at build time by Metro,
> not at container startup. Passing `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` as a Docker env
> var alone will not work — it must be set before the bundle compiles.
> For local use the default `http://localhost:8787` works fine. For reverse
> proxy deployments pass your public API URL at build time (see Option B).

---

### Option A — GHCR Pre-built Image (Recommended)

A pre-built image is available on GitHub Container Registry — no build step
required. Best for local deployments using the default API URL.

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/variablenix/openpostings:latest

# Create data directory and DB file
mkdir -p ./data && touch ./data/jobs.db

# Start both containers
docker compose -f docker-compose.example.yml up -d
```

Then open `http://localhost:3001` and hit **Sync Postings**.

> The pre-built image uses `http://localhost:8787` as the default API URL.
> If you are running behind a reverse proxy with a public-facing API URL,
> use Option B to build a custom image with your URL baked in.

---

### Option B — Build Locally

Use this if you need a custom API URL baked in (reverse proxy, remote server,
Cloudflare Tunnel, etc.) or if you want to build from source.

**Before you build — two things to know:**

1. **Debian Trixie is required as the base image.** The `sqlite3` native addon
   requires glibc 2.38+. Standard Node.js images use Debian Bookworm (glibc
   2.36) and will fail at runtime with `ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED`. The provided
   `Dockerfile` uses `node:20-trixie-slim` which has glibc 2.38 and just works.

2. **The API URL must be set at build time.** The variable name is
   `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` — note the `_BASE` suffix. Using
   `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` without it will not work.

```bash
# Local deployment (default API URL)
bash docker-build.sh

# Behind a reverse proxy (API URL baked in at build time)
bash docker-build.sh https://your-api.example.com

# Create data directory and DB file
mkdir -p ./data && touch ./data/jobs.db

# Start both containers
docker compose -f docker-compose.example.yml up -d
```

Then open `http://localhost:3001` and hit **Sync Postings**. The first sync
crawls all ATS sources and takes a while — it runs server-side so you can
close the browser tab and come back later.

---

### Reverse Proxy Setup

You'll need two upstream entries pointing at the same host:

| Host | Upstream | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `postings.example.com` | `http://localhost:3001` | Frontend UI |
| `postings-api.example.com` | `http://localhost:8787` | API |

---

### Keeping Your Data

Job data is stored in `jobs.db` inside the `openpostings-api` container at
`/app/jobs.db`. The example compose file bind-mounts it to `./data/jobs.db`
on the host so it survives container restarts. Skip this and you'll need to
resync from scratch every time you recreate the container.

---

### Updating

**Option A (GHCR image):**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.example.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.example.yml up -d --force-recreate
```

**Option B (local build):**
```bash
git pull
bash docker-build.sh        # add your API URL if using a reverse proxy
docker compose -f docker-compose.example.yml up -d --force-recreate
```

---

## Chrome Extension (For Capturing/Adding more companies to your app)

This repo includes a Chrome extension at:

- `chrome-extension/openpostings-seeded-url-capture`

It captures the active tab URL and submits it to OpenPostings as a **seeded ATS company source**.
Dynamic ATS sources are intentionally blocked.

### Load as Unpacked Extension

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable `Developer mode`.
3. Click `Load unpacked`.
4. Select `OpenPostings/chrome-extension/openpostings-seeded-url-capture`. (The folder where the chrome extension is)

### Run Backend + Extension

1. Start backend:

```powershell
cd OpenPostings
npm run server
```

NOTE: Or if you are using the Windows MSI installer version, just have your backend service set to `running`.

2. Open a seeded ATS company board URL in Chrome.
3. Open the extension popup.
4. Confirm/edit:
   - Backend API URL (default `http://localhost:8787`)
   - Source URL and company name
5. Click `Add to OpenPostings`.

### Example Supported Seeded URL Patterns

- Workday: `https://<subdomain>.wd*.myworkdayjobs.com/<companyPath>`
- Ashby: `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/<orgSlug>`
- Greenhouse: `https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/<boardToken>` or `https://boards.greenhouse.io/<boardToken>`
- Lever: `https://jobs.lever.co/<organization>`
- iCIMS: `https://<tenant>.icims.com/jobs/search?...`
- BambooHR: `https://<tenant>.bamboohr.com/careers`
- Jobvite: `https://jobs.jobvite.com/<companySlug>/jobs`
- It works for all 80+ ATSs!

### Troubleshooting

- `Failed to fetch`:
  - Ensure backend is running at `http://localhost:8787`.
  - If backend runs elsewhere, update backend URL in the extension popup.
- `URL does not match a supported seeded ATS company source`:
  - The current page is likely not a seeded ATS company board URL.
- `Dynamic ATS URLs are not supported`:
  - Expected behavior. This extension only inserts seeded ATS company sources.

MCP helper endpoints:

- `GET /mcp/candidates`
- `POST /mcp/cover-letter-draft`
- `POST /mcp/applications/complete`

## MCP Apply Agent Server

You can have Codex/Claude/Gemini/Qwen/LLMs do the following for you:
- Get your applicantee information `get_applicant_context`
- Find the latest relevant jobs for you. `find_posting_candidates`
- Apply to those jobs (As long as your LLM model has access to a browser)
- Build a dynamic cover letter for you that relates to your resume, experience and the job you are applying for. `draft_cover_letter`
- Update job application tracking for you. `record_application_result`

To turn on the MCP server so your model can interact with OpenPostings run:

```powershell
cd OpenPostings
npm run mcp:apply-agent
```

MCP server setup for your Codex (If you use a different LLM, ask it to setup an MCP setup for you):
```
[mcp_servers.openpostings-apply]
command = "node"
args = ['C:\Users\<path to where you cloned the repo>\OpenPostings\server\mcp-apply-server.js']
```

## Security Notes

This is designed for local/self-hosted usage.

- MCP credentials/settings are stored in local SQLite fields.
- If you need stricter controls, add OS-level secret storage, DB encryption-at-rest, and tighter filesystem permissions.
